        installing air conditioning that September 
        &#151; &quot;just in time for winter,&quot; noted the <i>Argonaut</i>. 
        As a result, the library began the '67/'68 academic year filled with the 
        noise of jackhammers. &quot;There is a contest going on to determine who 
        can remain in the building the longest without going 
        completely mad,&quot; added the <i>Argonaut</i>. 
        &quot;We must direct some pity on the long-suffering staff...employees 
        have been seen running wild-eyed from the place, with 'quiet' signs tucked 
        under their arms.&quot;</span></p>

        workers replaced the 10-year-old library building's plastic ceiling &#151;

        departure, in June 1968, Warren Owens was hired as the new Director of 
        Libraries. A native of Massena, NY, and raised in Battle Creek, MI, he 
        had been director of libraries at Temple University from 1961 to 1968.

        increased involvement of librarians, including Owens, on university committees,

      <p align="left" margin-top: 4><span class="mccallum">Kellogg's successor, 
        humanities librarian Milo Nelson, took a keen interest in Ezra Pound, 
        who was born in Hailey, ID, and in the early 1970s the library's special 
        collections unit began building a Pound collection. The collection grew 
        to include first editions, signed copies, transcripts of FBI files on 
        Pound, and a complete run of <i>Paideuma</i>. Some items were donated 
        by Pound's daughter, Princess Mary de Rachewitz of Italy, whom Nelson 
        contacted.</span></p>
      <p align="left" margin-top: 4><span class="mccallum">Eventually, Nelson 
        proposed that the library and English department sponsor an annual lecture 
        series honoring Pound. Soon additional schools became involved (Foreign 
        Languages, Communication, Art &amp; Architecture, ASUI), along with private 
        benefactors, and the guest lecturers included Buckminster Fuller (1977) 
        and Marshall McLuhan (1978), among others, before the series ended in 
        1982.</span></p>

        1975, the library replaced its bag-checking with a 3M automated security 
        system that beeped and locked the gate whenever someone passed through 
        without checking out his books. Costing $16,000, the system curbed the 
        theft of hundreds of books each year.</span></p>
      <p align="left" margin-top: 4><span class="mccallum">Carpets were another 
        matter. Although it makes for a quieter facility, carpeting had been considered 
        an unaffordable luxury when the library was first built in 1957. In 1971, 
        the library made a brief attempt to quell noise by piping background music 
        into the lobby(!). Eventually, in 1979, carpet was laid on some floors 
        &#151; one room at a time &#151; with income from the library's vending 
        machines.</span></p>

        following month, eight librarians became the first to receive tenure. 
        In June 1977, two librarians married each other. That October, the library 
        bought 76,000 pounds of second-hand steel shelving capable of holding 
        175,000 books. And in December 1978, the library received the 754-volume 
        personal library of longtime Moscow resident Kyle Laughlin, which included 
        first editions of Washington Irving's <i>Astoria</i> (1836), Alexander 
        MacKenzie's <i>Voyages from Montreal</i> (1801), and Alexander Ross's

        card catalog had become gargantuan, as well as expensive &#151; labor-intensive 
        &#151; to maintain, requiring the typing and filing of some 200,000 cards 
        annually. &quot;The card catalog is a complex tool, and the larger it 
        grows, the more difficult it becomes to use,&quot; noted Owens. As well, 
        &quot;we have run out of space in which to accommodate its growth without 
        expensive remodelling.&quot;</span></p>

        finding their way into the library for years. Circulation functions were 
        becoming computer-automated. December 1976 saw the library's first <i>publicly 
        accessible</i> computer installed in the Social Sciences division, for 
        educational research. But the first real progress on the long road toward 
        today's Web-accessible online catalog came with the library's joining 
        the Washington Library Network (WLN) in July 1979. This added the library's 
        holdings to a computerized &quot;union catalog,&quot; which contained the holdings 
        of 60 libraries across the Pacific Northwest. Moreover, this catalog could 
        be printed at regular intervals onto microfiche sheets, which were readable 
        on a microfiche reader installed in the library's lobby. From this point 
        on, library staff began recording data about the library's holdings on 
        computer instead of on 3&quot; by 5&quot; cards. The days of the card 
        catalog, which M. Belle Sweet had begun in 1909, were numbered. However, 
        &quot;becoming a WLN participant was, very simply, a matter of our survival,&quot;

        around the library. &quot;Ficheing&quot; for material provided library users with 
        faster and more comprehensive book-searching. But it also bred some confusion. 
        Many users didn't understand the alphabet-soup location codes (i.e. &quot;IdU&quot; 
        or &quot;WaOE&quot;) and wrongly assumed that <i>all</i> the items listed on the 
        fiches could be found in the UI Library (whereas many were available only 
        from other libraries in the WLN system).</span></p>
      <p align="left" margin-top: 4><span class="mccallum">A few years were required 
        for the library's entire collection to be brought into the WLN system 
        &#151; a process known as &quot;retrospective conversion,&quot; since 
        newer items were included first, and older ones (particularly pre-1968) 
        were then added over time. By the end of 1981, records for 60% of the 
        library's books and serials had been computerized, and by the late 1980s 
        the process was complete. Thus for a long time, someone doing a thorough 
        search had to look in multiple locations <span class="mccallum">&#151;</span> 
        the fiches for recent materials, the catalog for older materials, and 
        fiche cummulative supplements for the most-recent materials.</span></p>
      <p align="left" margin-top: 4><span class="mccallum">The next stage came

        LaserCat also boasted superior keyword searching capabilties. Of course, 
        these standalone CD-ROM computers were themselves merely a precursor to

        years old and crowding was evident throughout &#151; increasing numbers 
        of books in storage; fewer and smaller study areas; staff work areas crowded 
        to the point of inefficiency; and a chronic lack of space for new facilities.

        library. One of the most frequent comments on the questionnaire was, &quot;Why 
        did you send it first class rather than through campus mail?&quot; Among 
        the highlights of the 54-page report: faculty were nearly unanimous that 
        students should learn to use the library; the most important library services 
        were deemed to be journals, followed by books, then self-service photocopiers, 
        database searching, and orientation sessions for new faculty and students. 
        As a result, UI librarians began a cooperative program with the English 
        department to provide a few days' instruction to all freshmen, as a component 
        of English 104. </span></span></p>

        to be completed by the end of 1993.</span></span></p>
      <p align="left" margin-top: 4><span class="mccallum"><span class="mccallum">The 
        plan was to construct, on the north side of the building, a 60,000-square-foot 
        addition (half the size of the existing building) to all five levels (including 
        the basement). The entrance, then still on the building's east side, would 
        be relocated to the north side. Once the addition is completed, the rennovation 
        would begin, with special attention to the heating, coooling, ventilating 
        and electrical and lighting systems. The plan set certain goals:</span></span></p>

          and most of the self-service copiers;</span></span></li>
        <li><span class="mccallum"><span class="mccallum">reduce noise by separating

          points as possible, to make better use of personnel and thus expand 
          hours of service; this led to the amalgamation of circulation and reserves, 
          and the elimination of separate reference desks for sciences, the humanities 
          and the social sciences;</span></span></li>
