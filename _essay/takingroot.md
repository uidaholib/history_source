        functioning in the university's gymnasium for a couple of years, and then 
        in Morrill Hall for 16 months, all in the wake of the 1906 fire, the library 
        moved again, in December 1909, to the south wing of the <i>new</i> Administration 
        Building, where it occupied one large room, an office, and a small newspaper 
        room.</span></p>

        its new library, which was well-lighted and ventilated and boasted new 
        furniture and steel stacks. But it still lacked an important tool &#151; 
        a card catalog listing books by author, title and subject. Lack of a catalog 
        meant considerable lost time in locating specific books for students and 
        faculty. Work began on a public card catalog in January 1909, but continued 
        only sporadically during staff's spare time.</span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">The pace picked up, however, in fall 
        1913 when the library acquired another professional position &#151; filled 
        by Miss Ida Wolf, a graduate of Drexel Institute, Philadelphia. Wolf had 
        had several years' cataloging experience at the Iowa State Normal School 
        in Cedar Rapids, IA, and began serious work on cataloging and classifying 
        the library's collection into the Dewey Decimal system. (As recently as 
        <img src="images/clockopt.gif" width="110" height="127" align="left">the 
        1990s, the library would refer to its online catalog as &quot;Ida.&quot;)</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">Wolf's arrival also enabled the library 
        to extend its hours &#151; as students and faculty had been demanding 
        &#151; to include weekday evenings and earlier openings on Saturdays. 
        Librarian M. Belle Sweet even began offering a few classes in library 
        science &#151; indeed, she aspired to develop a full-blown library school 
        at the university (a dream that was never realized). She also saved documents 
        of various kinds, which would help lay the foundations of the library's 
        special collections unit. </span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum"><img src="images/book.gif" align="left" width="94" height="321" hspace="2">Meanwhile, 
        Sweet sought out the standard historical works on the Pacific Northwest, 
        including British Columbia. &quot;We bought everything that pertained to Northwest 
        history, insofar as we could wrangle the money,&quot; she later recalled. And 
        at her urging, the university administration formed a faculty library 
        committee in fall 1905 under her direction, to help develop a strategic, 
        long-range approach to collection development.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">Gifts were also an important factor 
        in building the library's collections. Principal donors included Senator 
        William E. Borah. The frugal war years slowed the library's efforts to 
        build a collection (particularly German books, which became extremely 
        hard to obtain).</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">And with increases in students and 
        holdings, the library was soon pressed for space. A request to the Carnegie 
        Foundation for $50,000 to build a separate library building was turned 
        down. As Sweet reported to the Regents,</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="mccallum"><img src="images/booksopt.gif" width="150" height="282" align="right">&quot;At 
          present there is room for only one hundred chairs. Room is also required 
          for additional shelving, as the space now used is overcrowded and books 
          have to be stored in the basement, where they are being injured by dampness, 
          and where they are difficult to access&#133; In order to provide shelving 
          for new books we should have at least ten floor cases like those now 
          in the Library&#133; Additional tables and chairs for fifty should be provided. 
          By very much overcrowding, these could be placed in the present reading 
          room&#133;&quot;</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">But by 1914, the university was coping 
        with general crowding &#151; enrolment had grown by 50 percent in just 
        three years, to nearly 1,000 students. So the push was to finish the south 
        wing of the Administration Building. With that completed in 1921, the 
        library was relocated to the first floor and the basement of the new addition.</span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">The new space quickly proved inadequate, 
        however, as the Idaho State Board of Education reported in the mid-1920s: 
        &quot;The University of Idaho is sadly hampered by lack of library space&#133; Now 
        there is hardly an hour in the day when students in considerable numbers 
        are not turned away from the reading room because of lack of slots and 
        table space.&quot;</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">During the early 1920s the library 
        also suffered from particularly high staff turnover, due to its uncompetitive 
        salaries, forcing the library to train inexperienced people as best it 
        could.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">Nonetheless, by the mid-1920s, a 
        separate library building, with a $300,000 price tag, became a new rallying 
        cry. With enrolment <img src="images/student.gif" align="right" width="147" height="136">topping 
        2,000, the <i>Argonaut</i> quoted university president A. H. Upham as 
        saying, &quot;The big need on the campus is more library space and the institution 
        must ask the state legislature for an appropriation for the next biennium 
        in order to build a library building.&quot;</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">But the administration had a second 
        motive &#151; to free up the library's space in the Administration Building, 
        noted the <i>Argonaut</i> in August 1926: &quot;Why does the University of 
        Idaho need a new library? I. Because there isn't room enough for the students 
        in the present library. II. Because there isn't room enough for the present 
        library in the Administration building.&quot;     [<a href="prankarticle.htm"><font color="#330000"><u>Prank 
        article from the <i>Argonaut</i></u></font></a>]</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">However, the optimism was unwarranted 
        &#151; the building didn't materialize. Even the library's operating budget, 
        poor during the 1920s, grew abyssmal during the Depression. When the university 
        sustained budget cuts, the library was usually among the areas worst hit.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum"><img src="images/frog.gif" align="left" width="100" height="66">Yet 
        Sweet was feisty, and had no qualms about going straight to the president 
        with her problems. Librarian Nancy Atkinson recalled that when Sweet discovered 
        frogs in the leaky basement, she gathered them up and dropped them on 
        the president's desk, requesting more and better space. Usually, though, 
        she used statistical reports to prove the need for space.</span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">Eventually, in 1936, the university 
        received a $50,000 federal grant to help build 
        another addition to the Administration Building. When completed, most 
        of the wing was given over to the library, though it was recognized even 
        then that a separate library building was preferable. But that wasn't 
        to come for decades yet.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">The library's policy was to hire 
        students for clerical work. And because many students were so poor, the 
        library also bought copies of textbooks and placed them on reserve, which 
        meant the reserve desk was very busy. As well, the library still functioned 
        with &quot;closed stacks&quot;, which meant staff still had to retrieve 
        materials as users requested them, so the loans and periodicals desks 
        were busy, too. In the early 1940s, library faculty voluntarily accepted 
        a 10 percent salary cut to free up more money to hire students (at a time 
        when the university had no retirement program or medical insurance).</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum"><img src="images/womanstudent.gif" width="88" height="145" align="left">By 
        1941 the library had seven librarian positions &#151; university librarian 
        (Sweet), assistant librarian, loan librarian, reference librarian, and 
        two catalog librarians &#151; in addition to three assistants. But by 
        1943, regular staff had dwindled to 4.5 &#151; less than half the complement 
        two years earlier &#151; and librarians were performing multiple roles. 
        Meanwhile, due to wartime enlistment, university enrolment plummeted &#151; 
        from 2,851 in 1940-41 to 953 in 1944-45 (the lowest level since 1920-21). 
        The university's population was buoyed, however, by some on-campus specialized 
        military-training programs &#151; up to 600 Army and 800 Navy personnel 
        at a given time. So the library remained busy. Indeed, half the library's 
        second floor was taken over for military classrooms.</span></p>

      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">On the collection front, the library 
        was making important strides. In 1941, Jerome J. Day's personal library 
        was donated to the university. Added to what Sweet had already collected 
        of Northwest Americana, it made the Day Northwest Collection an outstanding 
        asset. Meanwhile, the library had been forging strong ties with the Washington 
        State University Library, eight miles away in Pullman, WA, and UI professors 
        were making good use of interlibrary loans. On several occasions, staff 
        of the two libraries even attended joint picnics.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="mccallum">Short, stocky and still in good health, 
        Sweet was now well into her 60s. An Associate Librarian, Martin Schmidt, 
        was hired in 1946, the intention being to train him to replace Sweet. 
        But Schmidt said he was not being given enough responsibility, and took 
        a job at the University of Oregon Library in 1947.</span></p>

        He came for interviews and lunch with the dean and president in October, 
        during which he was told that a new library was in the works &#151; though
