2000 credits: 

The website is based on *The University of Idaho Library: A History*, by Richard J. Beck and Robert D. Hook (typescript, 1986).

Condensing, rewriting, additional research, and Web design and development were carried out by Larry McCallum.

Special thanks to the folks in Special Collections for help in photo research, and for providing some excellent scans.
